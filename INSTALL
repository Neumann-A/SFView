Installing SFView
=================

SFView can be compiled for Windows or Linux computers. The following description only deals with the compilation for Linux.
Windows users are encouraged to use Qt Creator for compilation.

1) Preconditions
SFView uses the Qt toolkit, version 4.7.x or higher, including 5.x versions. This must be installed including the development files.
Qt can be obtained from http://qt-project.org/downloads, but in many cases it is available prepackaged in your Linux installation.
Please ensure that the development packages (typically called qt4-devel) are also installed.

2) Unpacking
Place the file SFView.tar.gz into a directory of your choice, open a terminal window, navigate to the chosen directory and unpack the archive by
 
  tar xvfz SFView.tar.gz

This will create a new directory SFView containing all source files.

3) Creating a build directory
Besides the source folder, create a build folder by typing

  mkdir build-sfview

4) Configuring the build
Type the following commands:

  cd build-sfview
  qmake -o Makefile ../SFView

If this fails, please check whether Qt is correctly installed and the qmake tool is in your search path.

5) Building
Build the application by typing

  make release

6) Testing
You can start the application from the build directory by typing

  ./SFView
